         You are invited to participate in a research study of activity in patients who are considering having an operation. We hope to learn how activity changes over time in people who undergo procedures and how changes in activity could predict your speed to recovery. You are eligible for this study if you are older than 18 years old and speak English. Health information provided by you and by reviewing your health records will be used to identify trends between physical fitness, participant demographics and outcomes. Furthermore, certain non-personally identifying information collected and analyzed in this study may be shared with external research partner(s). This research study is looking for 1000 participants.

        You are invited to participate in a research study investigating the use of a smartphone app to monitor activity data and to help observe recovery following surgery when combined with electronic health record data. You will undergo routine standard of care for your diagnosis and present to your surgeon’s office. Based on your surgeon’s determination, you will be scheduled for elective surgery. Following the mutual decision to proceed with surgery, you will be approached during check-in for your scheduled pre-operative outpatient appointment at Stanford or during the same appointment.

        You will be informed about the purpose of the study, the research procedures and asked if you would like to enroll. If you would like to enroll, Informed consent will be obtained through VascTrac X smartphone application. You will download the application, create an account and accept the consent and end user license agreement.

        The smartphone application will then be used to administer two surveys before surgery. The Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) survey will be used to assess your physical activity. The Risk Analysis Index (RAI) will be used to assess patient pre-operative risk. Activity data (step count, walking and running) of at least 30 days duration prior to surgery will be collected by VascTrac X.

        You will self-report data that enables calculation of a surgical risk score to establish baseline peri-operative clinical risk. The surgical risk score is based upon age, gender, comorbidities (acute and chronic) as well as characteristics of the surgery itself. A digital 6 minute walking test, or how far you are able to walk in 6 minutes, will be used to test your exercise capacity before surgery. The test will be performed by you, unobserved by study stuff. The test may be performed indoors or outdoors. Indoor tests should be performed in long unobstructed hallways and by walking laps. Walk at a comfortable pace and you may slow down, lean on a wall or stop and rest as necessary. Resume walking when able. If you have recently fainted, have worsening shortness of breath or have developed any new medical condition that may prevent walking or be worsened by walking, please contact the study team before performing the test. You will then undergo surgery.

        On post discharge day 1, activity and post-operative outcomes will be monitored and collected via the mobile application and research team follow-up. On post discharge day 30, an additional WIQ and RAI survey will be conducted. The study duration for patients will be 3.5 months. An additional digital 6-minute walking test will be conducted 30 and 60 days after surgery.

        The total time commitment from the patient perspective is two hours. Once total study enrollment is concluded, we will then aggregate all patient data in a de-identified format and run our models and evaluate how well they predict post-operative outcomes. Stanford University is providing financial support and/or material for this study.

        Future Use of Private Information:
        Research using private information is an important way to try to understand human disease.  You are being given this information because the investigators want to save private information for future research.

        Identifiers might be removed from identifiable private information and, after such removal, the information could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from you.
