			<key>Title</key>
			<string>Purpose of Research</string>
			<key>Summary</key>
			<string>VascTrac is a research study of activity in patients who are considering having an operation. We hope to learn how activity changes over time in people who undergo procedures and how changes in activity could predict your recovery.</string>
			<key>Content</key>
			<string>You are invited to participate in a research study of activity in patients who are considering having an operation. We hope to learn how activity changes over time in people who undergo procedures and how changes in activity could predict your speed to recovery. You are eligible for this study if you are older than 18 years old and speak English. Health information provided by you and by reviewing your health records will be used to identify trends between physical fitness, participant demographics and outcomes. Furthermore, certain non-personally identifying information collected and analyzed in this study may be shared with external research partner(s). This research study is looking for 1000 participants.</string>

			<key>Content</key>
			<string>Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary.  Your decision not to participate will not have any negative effect on you or your medical care.  You can decide to participate now but withdraw your consent later and stop being in the study without any loss of benefits or medical care you are entitled to.</string>

			<string>Time Commitment</string>
			<key>Summary</key>
			<string>Your participation will take about 1 hour per month for 6 months to 1 year. This consists of one-time registration, a weekly walking test, and medical questionnaires every 3 months.</string>
			<key>Content</key>
			<string>Your participation will take approximately 60 minutes per month for 6 months to one year.  The time commitment is broken down as follows: this research study involves three main components. The first component is the registration process. This takes approximately 15 minutes and is only during the initial registration for the study. The second component is a 6-minute walking test, which takes approximately 15-minutes to perform. Participants will be asked to perform a walk test every week with up to four walk tests a month. The third component is filling out questionnaires about your medical history, surgical history and how you are feeling overall. This will be performed every 3 months and will take approximately 10 minutes to perform. If you need help filling out these surveys, you may ask the help of your care provider.  
   
At the conclusion of the study you have the option of deleting/removing the application from your device or may continue using the application. If you continue to use the study application we will also continue collecting activity data for up to 5 years.
 
More information about what you will be asked to do and the data that will be collected is described below under the headings ‚ÄúPROCEDURES‚Äù and ‚ÄúSTUDY DATA‚Äù.</string>

			<string>Procedures</string>
			<key>Summary</key>
			<string>The investigators will not require any medical procedures to be performed during the study. The investigators will monitor your activity using the activity tracker of your mobile phone and sometimes a research-grade activity tracker (accelerometer). In this study, you will primarily be asked to create a profile, complete medical questionnaires regarding walking impairment, and take 6-minute walking tests.</string>
			<key>Content</key>
			<string>The investigators will not require any medical procedures to be performed during the study. The investigators will monitor your activity using the activity tracker of your mobile phone and sometimes a research-grade activity tracker (accelerometer). The information described below under ‚ÄòStudy Data‚Äô will be collected by the VascTrac app which you will interact with to complete the tasks below and a second app. If you have questions about this app please contact a VascTrac team member
 
The researchers may also study any previous physical activity data stored on your phone and will use your electronic health record to document your past medical history.  
 
In the study, you will be asked to do the following:
¬∑  	First, create a profile by answering basic demographic information about 
yourself, including your date of birth, gender, smoking status, and type of 
planned surgery.
¬∑  	Second, complete the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ). This 
survey is comprised of 22 questions which ask why, if at all, you had 
difficulty walking and then ask about the degree of physical activity you have undertaken over the last week.
¬∑  	Third, to perform 6-minute walk tests and allow collection of certain activity 
data, such as your physical activity, accelerometer, gyroscope, and daily 
movement data in the background. 
¬∑  	More information about the data that will be collected from you in the study 
is described below under the heading ‚ÄúSTUDY DATA‚Äù.
¬∑  	Finally, to study the effect of app design on protocol compliance, you may 
be randomly selected to receive newly designed versions of the app as it 
is updated through the app store and receive different types of reminders, 
such as a phone call or in-app message.
 
In case of technical difficulty, you may contact a VascTrac team member who can help you enroll in the study on your phone.</string>
